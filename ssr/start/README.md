## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# Mock Api for Server Side Rendering Example

This sample application will make an http request to fetch data which allows us to see how Static Site Generation works. We will be using Mockoon to quickly spin up the endpoints our application will be requesting.

## Download Mockoon

Follow the installation instructions on this website:
https://mockoon.com

We are using Mockoon to quickly spinup and mock a response for the products in our workshop application.

## Starting the endpoint

To setup and start the server, select `open environment` from the `file` menu. 
Select `mockoon.json` from the root of this project as the environment.
Click the littler green arrow on the top left hand side of the header or select `Start/Stop/Reload Current Environment` from the `run` menu.

At this point the endpoint should be running and accepting requests.
